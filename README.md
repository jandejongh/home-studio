# home-studio
Insight into my home-studio setup.

## Introduction
At this time of writing, I've started to get totally confused about my home-studio setup (guitar, bass, piano, ...),
and I decided to document it on github.

## Background

I (try to) play guitar since 1986 or something.

At the present time, I play an Ibanez RG3120VV (mostly),
a Squier Jazz Bass and a Yamaha YDP-161 electronic piano.

I'm a Linux adopt since 1991.
At home, I run several Linux-based services (DHCP/DNS, NIS, Internet, NAS/NFSv4, CUPS) on various platforms,
mostly running Fedora (all desktop clients), OpenWRT (for the Internet gateway),
Debian (on embedded boards like PCEngine's ALIX and APU)
and Raspbian (on all RPi's).
I use CAT5 Ethernet throughout my house, as well as 802.11 WLAN.
